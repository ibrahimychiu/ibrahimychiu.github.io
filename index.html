            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am <a href="https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/chiu0103">Ibrahim Chiu</a> (he/him), a Ph.D. student in <a href="https://cla.umn.edu/polisci">the Department of Political Science</a> at <a href="https://twin-cities.umn.edu/">the University of Minnesota Twin Cities</a> (2022â€“present), specializing in comparative politics and methodology.
            </p>
            <p>
                My research interest lies in religion and politics, particularly the impact of modernization and its backlashes, and how religions adapt to or resist modernity. My core topics are political Islam, religious-right, political violence, and the intersection of religion and ethnicity. Currently, I serve as a research assistant to my advisor Dr. <a href="https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/colli433">Kathleen Collins</a>, examining Jihadism and Islamic radicalization in the Middle East and Central Asia. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In terms of methodology, I focus on mixed methods and causal inference. My work involves employing statistical techniques to triangulate causal hypotheses derived from qualitative research, conducting causal inference analyses using time-series cross-sectional (TSCS) data from large-scale surveys like <a href="https://www.asianbarometer.org/">Asian Barometers</a>, and utilizing spatial data to assess the causal effects of conflicts and policies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prior to moving to Twin Cities, I was a policy researcher at an education think tank while lecturing in the humanities at several private institutions in Hsinchu City, Taiwan. I earned my BA in 2017 and my MA in 2020, both from <a href="https://politics.ntu.edu.tw/">the Department of Political Science at National Taiwan University</a> (NTU) in Taipei, Taiwan.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond research and teaching, I am a fan of the <a href="https://www.fubonguardians.com/content/masterpage/Index">Fubon Guardians</a> (since 2003, formerly the Sinon Bulls) baseball team in the <a href="https://www.cpbl.com.tw/">Chinese Professional Baseball League</a> (CPBL) of Taiwan, and an amateur baseball player. Additionally, I have been trained for more than a dacade as a classical pianist. Born in Taitung, Taiwan, I consider Taipei, Taiwan, where I grew up, my hometown.
